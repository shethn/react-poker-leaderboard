## Thought Process

### Explanation
Since I do not have Node.js experience, I stubbed some data for use in my Redux store and added the ability
to add more players via a form.

### Miscellaneous Comments
I opted not to use SASS because of the minimalistic approach to this challenge. If project was more elaborate then
I would have used the help of `node-sass` and had multiple `.scss` files relating to their respective components.
